After graduating with my bachelors and minor, I plan to further my edcuation and obtain a Masters in User Experience. My career goal is becoming a web designer. 

### Hobbies

Aside from my academic goals, my hobbies consist of:

- Video Games ⌨
- Reading ✎
- Listening to Music ♬

### Coding

Although I am fairly new in regards to the coding space, I enjoy the freedom and flexibility this form of development offers in design. Coding allows me to create designs without restrictions that other third-party softwares may have. Understanding coding language has helped me appreciate the process of web development and web design more than ever before. 

### Technical Skills

My technical skills still require more practice. I am currently focused on gaining more skill in **Adobe software**, **coding**, and **technical writing**.
