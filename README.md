## About Me 🙋🏻‍♀️

### Education 📑

I am currently a student at Arizona State University. I am majoring in Technical Communication (User Experience). I am minoring in Human Systems Engineering. After graduating with my bachelors and minor, I plan to further my education and obtain a Masters in User Experience. My career goal is becoming a web designer and a technical writer. 

### Hobbies 🪗

Aside from my academic goals, my hobbies consist of:

- Video games ⌨

- Listening to music ♬

### Coding 👩🏻‍💻

Although I am fairly new in regards to the coding space, I enjoy the freedom and flexibility that this form of development offers in design. Coding allows me to create designs without restrictions that other third-party softwares may have. Understanding coding language has helped me appreciate the process of web development and web design more than ever before. 

### Technical Skills 📝

My technical skills still require more practice. I am currently focused on gaining more skill in Adobe software, coding, and technical writing.
