> *"Design is intelligence made visible." - Le Corbusier*



I am a passionate UX/UI designer dedicated to developing optimal interface designs that aim to solve usability conundrums by navigating overlooked user pain points and barriers. I practice user experience methodical research, applying my studies in human cognitive psychology and neural research to build strong design frameworks, analyzing user behavior to construct high fidelity interfaces that are functional, inclusive, universal, and accessible. My work highlights human-computer interaction in human systems research, psychology, website development, technical communication, marketing, and graphic design through an innovative, visionary standpoint.
